# ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/OTtNhTo.png) aXDR CMS 
##### Version Pre-Alpha 1.0.0
##### Mr.Mustache - Arctic Development

### Getting Started
> aXDR CMS is a fresh from scratch Emulation website which emulates HabboWEB in a different style. **aXDR** stands for Azure XDR Content Management System. Although this project is pretty different to the original version created by **Boris Akopov**, the fundamental idea of **XDR** has not changed. **XDR** WEB offered a better system that could overlap other projects with modern technologies and functions. Right now aXDR is divided into two parts: *aXDR WEB App* **(FrontEnd)** & *aXDR API* **(Backend)**. This repository is only for aXDR WEB App made in angular.

### Features
+ aXDR WEB App is currently working under *Angular 7.2*.
+ aXDR API is currently working under *ExpressJS*
